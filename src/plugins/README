Plugins
-------

Plugins provide common POSIX-like abstraction to underlying
resource capabilities which include drivers, system mechanisms,
and even simulated or modeled attribute values.  To create a
new plugin, simply register the devOps functors to a function
to provide a wrapper or adapter to the underlying specific
calls.  A number of provided plugins illustrate this capability
and should be used as a point of reference.

Obviously, there will be system and device dependencies for
building some of the plugins (i.e. PowerInsight and PowerGadget)
where you will need to download a separte library for linking
against.  However, the majority of the plugins should be at least
compilable on most linux based systems.

Currently supported:
  libpwr_piapidev	PIAPI

  libpwr_rapldev	Intel Running Average Power Limit (RAPL)
  libpwr_pgdev	  Intel Power Gadget API
  libpwr_wudev		WattsUp
  libpwr_xtpmdev	Cray XC30 Power Manager
  libpwr_cpudev	  System level CPU adjustments
  libpwr_apmdev   AMD Average Power Management
  libpwr_pmcdev   IBM Power8 Power Management (INCOMPLETE)
  libpwr_msrdev   LIBMSR
